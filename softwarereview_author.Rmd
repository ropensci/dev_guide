# Guide for Authors {#authors-guide}

```{block, type='summaryblock'}
This concise guide presents the software peer review process for you as a package author.
```

-   Consult our [policies](#policies) see if your package meets our criteria for fitting into our suite and is not overlapping with other packages.
    -    If you are unsure whether a package meets our criteria, feel free to open an issue as a pre-submission inquiry to ask if the package is appropriate.
-   Use [pkgcheck](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/), read and follow [our packaging style guide](#building), [reviewer's guide](#preparereview) to ensure your package meets our style and quality criteria.
    -   If you feel your package is in scope for the
        [Journal of Open-Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) (JOSS), do not submit it to JOSS consideration until after the rOpenSci review process is over: if your package is deemed in scope by JOSS editors, only the accompanying short paper would be reviewed, (not the software that will have been extended reviewed by rOpenSci by that time). Not all rOpenSci packages will meet the criteria for JOSS.
- Please consider the best time in your package's development to submit.  Your package should be sufficiently mature so that reviewers are able to review all essential aspects, but keep in mind that review may result in major changes.
    - For any submission or pre-submission inquiry the README of your package should provide enough information about your package (goals, usage, similar packages) for the editors to assess its scope without having to install the package. Even better, set up a pkgdown website for allowing more detailed assessment of functionality online.
    - If you use [repostatus.org badges](https://www.repostatus.org/) (which we recommend), submit when you're ready to get an _Active_ instead of _WIP_ badge. Similarly, if you use [lifecycle badges](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/), submission should happen if the package is at least _Maturing_.
    - At the submission stage, all major functions should be stable enough to be fully documented and tested; the README should make a strong case for the package (the editors will read it to e.g. evaluate this as in scope or not.).
    - We strongly suggest submitting your package for review _before_ publishing on CRAN or submitting a software paper describing the package to a journal. Review feedback may result in major improvements and updates to your package, including renaming and breaking changes to functions.
    - Your package will continue to evolve after review, this book [provides guidance about the topic](#evolution).
- In your initial (pre-)submission and README, strive to explain your package's functionality and aim assuming little to no domain knowledge from the reader. E.g. if you wrote something to interact with knitr engines, what's a knitr engine?
-   Do not submit your package for review while it or an associated manuscript is also under review at another venue, as this may result on conflicting requests for changes.
-   Next, [open a new issue](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/new/choose) in
the software review repository and fill out the template.
-   Communication between authors, reviewers and editors will first and foremost take place on GitHub so that the review thread can serve as a full record of the review. You may choose to contact the editor by email or Slack if private consultation is needed (e.g., asking how to respond to a reviewer question). Do not contact reviewers off-thread without asking them in the GitHub thread whether they agree to it.
- *When submitting a package please make sure your GitHub notification settings make it unlikely you will miss a comment.*
-   An [editor](#editors) will review your submission within 5 business days and respond with next steps. The editor may assign the package to reviewers, request that the package be updated to meet minimal criteria before review, or reject the package due to lack of fit or overlap.
-   If your package meets minimal criteria, the editor will assign  1-3 reviewers. They will be asked to provide reviews as comments on your issue within 3 weeks.
-   We ask that you respond to reviewers' comments within 2 weeks of the last-submitted review, but you may make updates to your package or respond at any time. Your response should include a link to the updated [NEWS.md](#news) of your package. Here is [an author response example](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/160#issuecomment-355043656).  We encourage ongoing conversations between authors and reviewers. See the [reviewing guide](#reviewerguide) for more details.
-   Once your package is approved, we will provide further instructions about the transfer of your repository to the rOpenSci repository.

Our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct) is mandatory for everyone involved in our review process.
