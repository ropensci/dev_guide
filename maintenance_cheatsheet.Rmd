## Help needed?

If you need punctual help (say, a PR review; or some CI troubleshooting), or help looking for co-maintainers or a new maintainer, or if you need us to retire your package, ping us in GitHub via `@ropensci/admin` or email `info@ropensci.org`.
You can also use our slack package maintenance channel.

Never hesitate to ask for help.

## GitHub repository access

You should have administrative access to your package's GitHub repository.
If that is no longer the case (say, the automated process failed; or you lost access after having to temporarily deactivate two-factor authentication), 
please contact us via `info@ropensci.org`.

## Other GitHub topics

If you have any GitHub question or request (adding a collaborator to the GitHub organization for instance) you can use a public channel of the rOpenSci slack workspace or ping `@ropensci/admin` on GitHub.

## pkgdown documentation

See [rOpenSci docs](#rodocsci).

## Access to rOpenSci slack workspace

Package maintainers and developers should get access to [rOpenSci slack](https://contributing.ropensci.org/resources.html#channels).

You might find the #package-maintenance channel relevant for Q&A as well as friendly commiseration when needed.
