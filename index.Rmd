# Preface {-}

Welcome! This book is a guide for authors, maintainers, reviewers and editors of rOpenSci.

The [first section of the book](#building) contains our guidelines for creating and testing R packages. 

The [second section](#onboardingintro) is dedicated to rOpenSci's onboarding process: what it is, our policies, and specific guides for authors, editors and reviewers throughout the process.

The [third and last section](#collaboration) features our best practice for nurturing your package once it has been onboarded: how to collaborate with other developers, how to document releases, how to promote your package and how to leverage GitHub as a development platform. The third section also features a [chapter for anyone wishing to start contributing to rOpenSci packages](#contributingguide).

We hope that you'll find the guide useful and clear, and welcome your suggestions in the [issue tracker of the book](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dev_guide/issues). Happy R packaging!

The rOpenSci editorial team.
