Dear [REVIEWER]

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a package for rOpenSci. As you probably know, rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (We’ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [packaging guide], and we provide a reviewer [template] for you to use. Please make sure you do not have a [conflict of interest](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#coi) preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me.

rOpenSci’s community is our best asset. 
We aim for reviews to be open, non-adversarial, and focused on improving software quality. 
Be respectful and kind! 
See our reviewers guide and [code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) for more.

[IF MENTORSHIP REQUESTED: You indicated in your form that you'd prefer mentorship for your first review.  
You are free to use me as a resource during this process, including asking questions by email and Slack (you will receive an invite to the rOpenSci Slack), and sharing draft reviews for feedback before posting. 
I'm also happy to have a brief videocall to walk through the process.  
Please let me know in your reply if you would like to schedule one.]

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to
review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]
