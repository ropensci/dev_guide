# Marketing your package

We will help you promoting your package but here are some more things to keep in mind.

* If you hear of an use case of your package, please send the link to Scott Chamberlain (e.g. via Slack or scott@ropensci.org) for inclusion in the [rOpenSci biweekly newsletter](https://ropensci.github.io/biweekly/). You can also add a link to the use case in an "use cases in the wild" section of your README.

* When you release a new version of your package or release it to CRAN for the first time, 

    * Make a pull request to [R Weekly](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org) with a line about the release under the "New Releases" section (or "New Packages" for the first GitHub/CRAN release).
    
    * Tweet about it and tag rOpenSci! Example.
