# Marketing your package {#marketing}

```{block, type="summaryblock"}
We will help you promoting your package but here are some more things to keep in mind.
```

- If you hear of an use case of your package, please encourage its author to post the link to our [discussion forum in the Use Cases category](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/usecases), [for a tweet from rOpenSci and possible inclusion in the rOpenSci biweekly newsletter](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/about-the-usecases-category/33). We also recommend you to add a link to the use case in a "use cases in the wild" section of your README.

- When you [release](#releasing) a new version of your package or release it to CRAN for the first time,
  
  - Make a pull request to [R Weekly](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org) with a line about the release under the "New Releases" section (or "New Packages" for the first GitHub/CRAN release).
  
  - Tweet about it using the "#rstats" hashtag and tag rOpenSci! This might help with contributor/user engagement. [Example](https://twitter.com/opencpu/status/1003934871830622208).
  
  - Consider submitting a short post about the release to [rOpenSci tech notes](https://ropensci.org/technotes/). Contact rOpenSci Community Manager, (e.g. via Slack or [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org)). Refer to [the guidelines about contributing a blog post](https://blogguide.ropensci.org)).
  
  - Submit your package to lists of packages such as [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/), and [rOpenSci non-CRAN Task Views](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aropensci+%22task+view%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).

- If you choose to market your package by giving a talk about it at a meetup or conference (excellent idea!)
