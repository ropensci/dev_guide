# Package Development Security Best Practices

This chapter isn't complete yet. It includes [guidance about managing secrets in packages](#pkgsecrets) and [links for further reading](#furthersecreading).

## Misc

We recommend you [secure your GitHub account with 2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

If the web service your package wraps has either https or http, opt for https.

## Secrets in packages {#pkgsecrets}

Guidance for when you develop a package interacting with a web resources asking for credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.). Also refer to [the `httr` vignette about sharing secrets](https://httr.r-lib.org/articles/secrets.html).

### Secrets in packages and user protection

Say your package needs an API key for making requests on behalf of your user.

* In your package documentation, try to make sure the API key won't end up in the .Rhistory/script of your user.

    * encourage the use of environment variables to store the API key (or even remove the possibility to pass it as an argument to the functions?). You could link [to this intro to startup files](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html) and [`usethis::edit_r_environ()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html).
    
    * you could depend on packages such as [`keyring` to help user store variables](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring#readme): i.e. you'd create a function for setting the key, and have another one for retrieving the key.
    
    * Do not print the API key even in verbose mode.

* In the GitHub issue template, it should be stated not to share any credentials (it's the case of [rOpenSci issue template](https://docs.ropensci.org/rodev/reference/use_ro_github.html)). If your user accidentally shares credentials in an issue, make sure they're aware of that so they can't revoke the key.

### Secrets in packages and development

You'll need to protect your secrets as you protect your users' secrets, but there's more to take into account and keep in mind.

#### Secrets and recorded requests in tests

If you use [`vcr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/) or [`httptest`](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/) in tests for caching API responses, you need to make sure the recorded requests / fixtures do not contain secrets. Refer to [`vcr` guidance](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/security.html) and [`httptest` guidance "Redacting and Modifying Recorded Requests"](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/articles/redacting.html), and inspect your recorded requests / fixtures before committing them the first time to be sure you got the setup right.

`vcr` being an rOpenSci package, you can post any question you might have to [rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/)

#### Share secrets with CI services

Now, you might need to share secrets with CI services such as Travis or GitHub Actions.

* You could store API keys as environment variables / secrets, referring to the docs of the CI service.

* For bigger secrets like tokens, refer [to the googlesheets guidance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/managing-auth-tokens.html#the-making-of-googlesheets.tar.gz-for-cran) that involves in particular the encryption of tokens for sharing them with Travis. Document the steps you made in a Markdown file so you, or say a new maintainer, can remember how to do that next time.

#### Secrets and collaborations

What about pull requests from external contributors? Tests using your secrets will fail, so you might want to skip them depending on the context. For instance, in your CI account you could create an environment variable called `THIS_IS_ME` and then skip tests based on the presence of this variable. This obviously means the PR checks by the CI are not exhaustive, so you'll need to check out the PR locally to run all tests.

You could also choose [a more complicated setup](https://blog.algolia.com/travis-encrypted-variables-external-contributions/).

Document the behavior of your package for external PRs in [CONTRIBUTING.md](#friendlyfiles).

### Secrets and CRAN

Skip any tests requiring credentials on CRAN.
