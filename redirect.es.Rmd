# How to set a redirect {#redirect}

## Non GitHub pages site (e.g. Netlify)

Replace the content of the current website with a `index.html` and `404.html` files both containing:

```html
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=https://docs.ropensci.org/<pkgname>/">  
</head>
</html>
```
    
## GitHub pages

You can setup the redirect from your main user gh-pages repository:

 - create a new repository (if you don't have one yet): `https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io`.
 - In this repository create a directory `<pkgname>` containing 2 files: a `index.html` and `404.html` file, which both redirect to the new location (see previous subsection).
 - Test that `https://<username>.github.io/<pkgname>/index.html` now redirects.
