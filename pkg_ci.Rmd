# Continuous Integration Best Practices {#ci}

```{block, type='summaryblock'}
This chapter summarizes our guidelines about continuous integration after explaining what continuous integration is.

Along with [last chapter](#building), it forms our guidelines for onboarding reviews.
```

## Why use continuous integration (CI)?

All rOpenSci packages must use one form of continuous integration. This ensures that all commits, pull requests, and new branches are run through `R CMD check`. rOpenSci packages' continuous integration must also be linked to a code coverage service, indicating how many lines are covered by unit tests.

Both test status and code coverage should be reported via badges in your package README.

## How to use continuous integration?

The `usethis` package offers a few functions for continuous integration setup, see [the docs](http://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/ci.html).

Details will be provided below for different services.

## Which continuous integration service(s)? {#whichci}

Different continuous integration services will support builds on different operating systems.

R packages should have CI for all platforms when they contain:

* Compiled code

* Java dependencies

* Dependencies on other languages

* Packages with system calls

* Text munging e.g. getting people's names (in order to find encoding issues).

* Anything with file system / path calls

### Travis CI (Linux and Mac OSX)

Travis offers continuous integration for Linux and Mac OSX. Set it up using `usethis::use_travis()`.

R is now a [natively supported language on Travis-CI](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-02-26-test-your-r-applications-on-travis-ci/), making it easier than ever to do continuous integration. See [R Packages](http://marker.to/NEr8Bd) and Julia Silge's [Beginner's Guide to Travis-CI for R](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Beginners-Guide-to-Travis/) for more help.

Please use these tips to minimize build time on Travis especially after your package project gets transferred to ropensci Travis account:

* Cache installation of packages. Add `cache: packages` at the beginning of the config file. [Example in the wild](https://github.com/ropensci/crul/blob/ee31c0128fd3279165360ef5ee2a1775ab00c82f/.travis.yml#L3). It'll already be in the config file if you set Travis up using `usethis::use_travis()`.

* [Enable auto-cancellation of builds](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-03-22-introducing-auto-cancellation).

### Appveyor CI (Windows)

For continuous integration on Windows, see [R + Appveyor](https://github.com/krlmlr/r-appveyor). Set it up using `usethis::use_appveyor()`.

Here are tips to minimize Appveyor build time:

* Cache installation of packages. [Example in a config file](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/blob/2c52c06373849d52f78a26c5a0e080f518a2f825/inst/templates/appveyor.yml#L13). It'll already be in the config file if you set Appveyor CI up using `usethis::use_appveyor()`.

* Enable [rolling builds](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#rolling-builds).

We no longer transfer Appveyor projects to ropensci Appveyor account so after transfer of your repo to the ropensci GitHub organization the badge will be `[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ropensci/pkgname?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/individualaccount/pkgname)`.

### Circle CI

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) is used, for example, by rOpenSci package [`bomrang`](https://github.com/ropensci/bomrang) as an alternative to Travis CI.

## Test coverage {#coverage}

Continuous integration should also include reporting of test coverage via a testing service such as [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/) or [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).  See the [README for the **covr** package](https://github.com/jimhester/covr) for instructions, as well
as `usethis::use_coverage()`. 

If you run coverage on several CI services [the results will be merged](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/merging-reports).

## Even more CI: OpenCPU

After transfer to the ropensci organization, each push to the repo will be built on OpenCPU and the person committing will receive a notification email. This allows an additional CI service for package authors that that allows for R functions in packages to be called remotely via https://ropensci.ocpu.io/ using the [opencpu api](https://www.opencpu.org/api.html#api-json). For more details about this service consult the OpenCPU [help page](https://www.opencpu.org/help.html) that also indicates where to ask questions.

## Make more of your CI builds: tic

The [`tic` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic) facilitates deployment tasks for R packages tested by Travis CI, AppVeyor, or the CI tool of your choice, cf e.g. our [suggestion to build and deploy the documentation website of your package via Travis](#website). Actually this book [uses `tic` for deployment](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide#technical-details).
