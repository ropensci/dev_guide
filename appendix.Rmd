# How to set a redirect {#redirect}

## Non GitHub pages site (e.g. Netlify)

Replace the content of the current website with

```html
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=https://docs.ropensci.org/<pkgname>/" />  
<script language="javascript">
  window.location.href = "https://docs.ropensci.org/<pkgname>"
</script>
</head>
</html>
```
    
## GitHub pages

You can setup the redirect from your main user gh-pages repository:

 - create a new repository (if you don't have one yet): `https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io`
 - In this repository create a directory `<pkgname>` containing the file `index.html` that redirects to the new location (see previous subsection)
 - Test that https://<username>.github.io/<pkgname>/index.html now redirects
 - Optional: you could even create a `404.html` file in your `<username>.github.io` repo to redirect arbitrary pages, like here: https://github.com/ropensci/ropensci.github.io.
