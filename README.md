### Suggestions and updates

This book contains our guidelines for packages contributed to [the rOpenSci suite of packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/). They are always a work in progress - corrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issue submissions in this repository](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/issues/new). Open discussions are welcome in our [forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/). You can also suggest changes by editing the `.Rmd` files that are at the root of this repository and submitting a pull request.  An "edit" button at the top of all book chapters will take you directly to the relevant page on GitHub to make such changes. Please target your pull requests to the `main` branch.

### Technical details

Deployment is done via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows).
The book has a production version https://devguide.ropensci.org/ and a development version https://devdevguide.netlify.com/
Both are updated when there are changes in their sources but also once a day to ensure the reviewers list is up to date (data pulled from Airtable).

* [prod.yml](.github/workflows/prod.yml): whenever there's a GitHub release, the book is built and its content is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. That branch serves ropensci.github.io/dev_guide which is redirected to https://devguide.ropensci.org/

* [scheduled-manual-main.yml](scheduled-manual-main.yml): once a day the book is built with the source from the latest release (see "Checkout latest release tag" step) and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

* [dev.yml](.github/workflows/dev.yml): whenever there's a push to the default branch `main`, and once a day, the book is built and its content is then pushed to the `dev-site` branch that gets [deployed to Netlify](https://devdevguide.netlify.com/).

* [pr.yml](.github/workflows/dev.yml): whenever there's a pull request to the default branch `main`, the book is built and its content is deployed via Netlify.

Refer to [this blog post for more details and resources about bookdown deployment on GitHub Actions](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/04/07/bookdown-learnings/#5-how-to-deploy-a-preview-of-the-book-for-pull-requests).

### Notes for associate editors

If you're an associate editor, you can also push directly to `main` for small fixes. We shall use PRs to `main` for discussing larger updates.

If you're an associate editor and you want to render the book locally you need to install Quarto and the other dependencies stated in [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) in particular use `pak::pak("bergant/airtabler")`, and [get and store an Airtable API key following their instructions](https://github.com/bergant/airtabler#get-and-store-the-api-key) (if you're not an editor, you don't have access to our Airtable base). Then use `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')` and the book will be generated in the `_book` folder; you can open the book on the command line by doing `open _book/index.html`.
