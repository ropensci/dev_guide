  description-meta: |
    Extended version of the rOpenSci packaging guide.
    This book is a guide for authors, maintainers, reviewers
    and editors of rOpenSci. The first section of the book contains
    our guidelines for creating and testing R packages.
    The second section is dedicated to rOpenSci's software peer review
    process: what it is, our policies, and specific guides for authors,
    editors and reviewers throughout the process.
    The third and last section features our best practice for nurturing
    your package once it has been onboarded: how to collaborate with
    other developers, how to document releases, how to promote your
    package and how to leverage GitHub as a development platform.
    The third section also features a chapter for anyone wishing
    to start contributing to rOpenSci packages.
