# Book release guidance {#bookreleaseissue}

Editors preparing for a release can run the `prelease.R` script in the `inst` directory of this repository to automatically open a GitHub issue with checkpoints for all current issues assigned to the upcoming release milestone, along with the following checklist.
Before running the script, please manually check the assignment of issues to the milestone.
This should be run one month prior to planned release.
